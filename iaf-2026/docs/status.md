# Modern IAF: status

What works and what is open, by work item ([plan.md](plan.md)). Newest first.

## Works
- **The sim's own look (2026-11-08, the Mac run):** the look switches whose 1998 value draws art the sim does not
  have are fixed to ours in `PROFILE`: Detailed airbases (the runways, taxiways and aprons were missing), the
  atmospheric sky, water, night lights, effects, the conformal ladder; the CC0 ground and model textures when setup
  downloaded them ([airbases.md](airbases.md) §9). `test_sim_look.gd`.
- **[E2](plan.md#e2-the-front-end), the front end (2026-11-08):** `./iaf2026` opens Home; Pick a plane, Training, Pick a mission, Fly,
  the flight, its debrief sheet, the Pilot log, Preferences and Attributions, in English and Hebrew (mirrored), in the
  round-3 look ([front-end.md](front-end.md)). Esc over a flight opens the pause menu. `test_front_end.gd`.
- **[A4](plan.md#a4-the-gate), the gates on the original's converted data and install (2026-11-08):** every path under
  `assets/converted` a shared script reads goes through `Settings.converted()`, every path under the install through
  `Settings.install()`; the sim refuses everything but its own converted data and the M0 probe fails on any refusal
  (0 today). The sim's own loading screen in English and Hebrew ([front-end.md](front-end.md) §7).
  The effects (flares, chaff, trails, afterburner, the gun's muzzle flash) draw a soft dot and the flight shows no message texts until the
  sim's own art and messages.
- **[A3](plan.md#a3-the-setup-wizard), the setup wizard (2026-11-03):** `./iaf2026-setup` opens the wizard; it builds the terrain,
  the airbases, the units and weapons, the sounds and voices and the training missions as a step graph with stamps (a
  second run is all up to date), in English and Hebrew ([setup.md](setup.md)). Its look is Godot's default theme until
  the user's next round.
- **[E3b](plan.md#e3-the-training-missions), the training missions in the game (2026-11-03):** `./iaf2026 -- --mission 2011` (… 2032) flies a start-up or
  take-off mission without the front end: parked cold, the start command (Ctrl+E) runs the jet's start sequence on
  the 6-DoF, the screens and the HUD come alive at the real moments; the radio menu (Ctrl+T, 1–3) asks the base's
  tower for start-up, taxi and take-off and the English TTS tower answers; at the end the flight is scored, the
  debrief record written to `user://debriefs/` and the attempt to the pilot log ([training.md](training.md) §7–§10).
  `iaf-2026/tests/test_mvp.gd` flies both missions for the Sufa, the Barak and the F-35I to a Pass.
- **[B2b](plan.md#b2-the-airbases), the airbases in the game (2026-11-03):** `iaf-sim airbases` compiles Ramon, Ramat David, Hatzerim and
  Nevatim into the theatre: `airbases.json` and paved masks (Detailed airbases), an own `iaf.ibx` and
  `terraintype.dat` ([airbases.md](airbases.md) §9); the missions start on the bases' parking spots; the M0 probe
  parks each jet on its spot, on the ground, at a base the flight model finds.
- **[B1](plan.md#b1-the-terrain), the terrain (2026-11-03):** `iaf-sim terrain` builds the sim's theatre `converted/terrain/israel/` from open
  data (GLO-30, Sentinel-2, the Survey of Israel), UTM 36N at 1:1 ([terrain.md](terrain.md)); the sim streams it
  (`theatre_dir()`); the M0 probe flies 5 s over it and checks the heights.
  Every download is shared with the original game in `assets/source/` (the WorldCover tiles in
  `source/imagery/sentinel2/`, also read by `iaf-imagery sentinel2`; the DEM in `source/dem/`): a complete cache
  builds with no network; the heights and the colour build at the same time ([terrain.md](terrain.md) §1.1, §4).
- **[C2](plan.md#c2-the-6-dof) stage (c), the 6-DoF flies the sim's jets (2026-11-03):** TP-1538's control system (g command, α limiter, roll
  and yaw), `Fm { Original, SixDof }` behind `IafFlight` chosen by `Model = 6dof` in the own data (the original game's
  data never reaches it, tested), fuel burn, Mach effects (inferred), the validation rows on the 6-DoF, a real Sufa
  flight in mission 311 ([flight-model.md](flight-model.md) §9.11–9.14).
- **[C2](plan.md#c2-the-6-dof) stage (b), engines, gear, the jets' data (2026-11-03):** TP-1538's engine model scaled to the F110-GE-100,
  F100-PW-229 and F135; a three-strut gear with brakes, steering and a braked stand; the four jets' mass, inertia and
  geometry; tests against the ratings, the spool times, a take-off roll and a stop ([flight-model.md](flight-model.md)
  §9.7–9.10). The take-off roll is 26 % short of the F-16A's SAC figure (open).
- **[C2](plan.md#c2-the-6-dof) stage (a), the 6-DoF's core (2026-11-03):** `crates/iaf-flight/src/sixdof/`: NASA TP-1538's aerodynamic
  tables checked value by value against the scan, appendix B's coefficient build-up, a quaternion rigid body; the
  trim tests match the report's trims and Stevens & Lewis's ([flight-model.md](flight-model.md) §9). Nothing calls
  it yet.
- **[D2](plan.md#d2-units-and-weapons) drafts (2026-11-03), pending the user's decision:** the threat set's 12 units and 10 weapons as readable
  records in `iaf-2026/data/db/drafts/`, every figure sourced; `iaf-sim db` skips them, and a test compiles them as if
  approved ([threat-records.md](threat-records.md)).
- **[A1](plan.md#a1-the-project-skeleton), the project (2026-11-02):** the `iaf-2026/` Godot project with its `shared` link, `sim_settings.gd`, the
  `install_dir()` / `own_dir()` / `keys_file()` calls in the shared code (the original game reads the same files as
  before), the launchers `./iaf2026` and `./iaf2026-setup` (+ `.ps1`), `tools/test.sh` over `iaf-2026/tests` and
  gdparse on both projects, the M0 probe.
- **Own sources for the flight-model type and the bases (2026-11-03):** the player's jet takes its flight-model type
  from the sim's table (`Settings.fm_section`), not the converted descriptor; `IafBases` reads `own_dir()`'s
  `iaf.ibx`, not the install's ([README.md](../README.md) "How the sim reads its data"). `test_own_sources.gd`.
- **The M0 probe (2026-11-02):** passes the no-install check, the profile, the key and sound tables, and for each jet
  the mission's object database, the aircraft definition, the motion table, the 3D cockpit model and the flight
  model's start from the own `bd.ibx` (item [C1](plan.md#c1-fm-0-data)'s FM-0 data; `NEEDS DATA` without that file). With the terrain built
  ([B1](plan.md#b1-the-terrain), the terrain) it flies 5 s over it and checks the heights; the 3D-only cockpit check waits for [E1](plan.md#e1-cockpit-data-sounds-and-voices), the cockpit data.
- [A2](plan.md#a2-the-iaf-sim-compilers) (the data compilers), [B2a](plan.md#b2-the-airbases) (the airbases' layouts), [E1b](plan.md#e1-cockpit-data-sounds-and-voices) (sounds, voices, keys), [E3a](plan.md#e3-the-training-missions) (the training scoring): see
  their rows in [plan.md](plan.md).
- The setup wizard's headings use Heebo's weights since 2026-11-08 (the font axis is set by its tag number; a "wght"
  string key had left every weight at the regular).

## Open
- **The 6-DoF's wave drag is a fit ([C2](plan.md#c2-the-6-dof), the 6-DoF):** fit to each jet's published top speeds, not a sourced table; open: a public
  F-16 drag rise, the high-speed g onset, the take-off roll, the flaps ([flight-model.md](flight-model.md) §9.6).
- **[E3b](plan.md#e3-the-training-missions)'s open points** ([training.md](training.md) §6): the Hebrew voice (the user), the
  pilot's request voice and the starter's sound (sound.md §7); the 6-DoF's short take-off roll.
- **[E2](plan.md#e2-the-front-end)'s open points** ([front-end.md](front-end.md)): a pilot list (the name is the computer's user
  name); the debrief sheet and the pilot log in the original game ([shared.md](shared.md)); the missions'
  own Hebrew briefings in `iaf-2026/data/missions/` still use the masculine imperative (the front end shows its own
  gender-neutral ones).
- **The probe's 3D-only cockpit check** (no 2D panel in flight) prints NEEDS DATA until [E1](plan.md#e1-cockpit-data-sounds-and-voices), the cockpit data.
- **The airbases' open points** ([airbases.md](airbases.md) §9): the towers of Ramon, Hatzerim and Ramat David (their
  reference points stand in), inland water, one taxi hub per base. The temp-root run of item F finds any read of the
  original's data still left.
